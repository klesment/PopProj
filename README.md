Population projection with dynamic fertility

Cohort-component method of population projection is a deterministic way to predict how the age composition and size of population change as time passes. Since future fertility, migration flows, and mortality rates are unknown, projections employ scenarios. For example, projecting the population of a low fertility country, one could expect that the future fertility stays the same, increases over the projection period, or even declines.

We produce a projection that allows the user to change the fertility scenario and manipulate the parameters of the future age-specfic fertility rates (mean age at birth and its dispersion). In addition, we allow the user to change how fast fertility changes over the projected period (ramp speed). For the sake of simplicity, scenarios will be applied only to fertility, while mortality rates are kept constant and international migration is not taken into account.

There is also a JupyterLab notebook that is composed in and imported from Google Colaboratory, including a link to Colab notebook if you prefer to run it on Google Drive..
